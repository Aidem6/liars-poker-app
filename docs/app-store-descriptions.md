**Liar's Poker - The Ultimate Bluffing Card Game**

Think you can spot a bluff? Liar's Poker combines the psychology of poker with strategic deception in a unique multiplayer card game where reading your opponents is just as important as the cards you hold.

**🎯 HOW TO PLAY**

In this twist on classic poker, you're not just playing your own cards—you're betting on poker hands that exist across ALL players' cards combined! Make bold claims about what hands you think are out there, from simple pairs to royal flushes. Your opponents can either raise the stakes with a higher bet or call you out with "Check" to reveal the truth.

Here's the catch: get caught in a lie and you gain a card. Lose too many challenges and collect 4 cards? You're eliminated! The last player standing wins.

**✨ KEY FEATURES**

🌍 **Real-Time Multiplayer** - Challenge friends or compete with players worldwide in fast-paced online matches

🤖 **Smart AI Bots** - Perfect your bluffing skills against intelligent computer opponents before facing real players

🃏 **Unique Poker Variant** - Master a special 24-card deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) and learn 11 different poker hand rankings

⚡ **Quick & Intense Rounds** - Games are fast-paced with escalating tension as players gain cards and risks get higher

🎨 **Beautiful Design** - Enjoy a clean, modern interface with both dark and light themes

💯 **100% Free** - No paywalls, no pay-to-win. The full game experience at no cost

**🎮 WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT**

Experience the thrill of high-stakes bluffing without risking a dime. Every round is a battle of wits where sharp observation and psychological warfare matter more than luck. Will you play it safe or take a bold gamble?

Perfect for:
